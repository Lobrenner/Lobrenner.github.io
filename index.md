### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first code that interacted with a person. Seeing the terminal ask questions and respond depending on the answer was really cool. It introduced some of the amazing possibilities that coding has.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was also one of my favorite labs because we got to see some practical use of coding. We also used 2D vectors which I struggled with a lot, but it was really satisfying finally figuring them out. This lab used the 2D vectors to match counties with their population size.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was my favorite lab because it showed how coding can create. In this lab we made animated images through coding. It showed the power of coding and how it can be used to make things from nothing.
